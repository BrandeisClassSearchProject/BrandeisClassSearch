This is an android app for brandeis students to search class.

The users can search by class number or class name, suggestions will be given.

For a better experience, use Android 7.0 (I know...it is too high...)

It will work perfectly in lower level systems, but only the list of books cannot be shown correctly. We are still currently debugging it.

The design is kept to a minimalist design.
